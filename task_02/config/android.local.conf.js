  // ==================
  // Specify Test Files
  // ==================
  // Define which test specs should run. The pattern is relative to the directory
  // from which `WebdriverIO` was called. Notice that, if you are calling `wdio` from an
  // NPM script (see https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) then the current working
  // directory is where your package.json resides, so `wdio` will be called from there.

  // ============
  // Capabilities
  // ============
  // Define your capabilities here. WebdriverIO can run multiple capabilities at the same
  // time. Depending on the number of capabilities, WebdriverIO launches several test
  // sessions. Within your capabilities you can overwrite the spec and exclude options in
  // order to group specific specs to a specific capability.
  //
  // First, you can define how many instances should be started at the same time. Let's
  // say you have 3 different capabilities (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) and you have
  // set maxInstances to 1; wdio will spawn 3 processes. Therefore, if you have 10 spec
  // files and you set maxInstances to 10, all spec files will get tested at the same time
  // and 30 processes will get spawned. The property handles how many capabilities
  // from the same test should run tests.

  // resolved to continue.
